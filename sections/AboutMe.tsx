          Hello,
          <br />
          <br />
          I&#39;m <span className="font-semibold">Omar Fandiño</span> and, as
          you may have read, I am an engineer, developer, and designer. The
          purpose of this website is to tell you more about me and what I do and
          will do in the future.
          <br />
          <br />I have always loved creating and learning new things. That
          curiosity led me to study{' '}
          <span className="font-semibold">engineering</span>. Computers were
          love at first sight: discovering that you can build amazing things
          with numbers and letters made me want to become a{' '}
          <span className="font-semibold">developer</span>. And since I also
          like everything I do to look incredible, I ended up becoming a{' '}
          <span className="font-semibold">designer</span>.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you like what you see on this website, please don&#39;t hesitate to{' '}
          <span className="text-primary font-semibold">contact me</span>.
          I&#39;d love to hear your ideas.
